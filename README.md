# Dog Emotion Detector

An end-to-end Machine Learning-based Dog Emotion Detection system that analyzes dog vocalizations to classify emotional states.

---

## Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting a dog's emotional state using audio-based features extracted from dog voice signals. The system applies Machine Learning techniques to preprocess data, encode features, and perform predictive classification.

The pipeline includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, dataset splitting, model training, and evaluation.
